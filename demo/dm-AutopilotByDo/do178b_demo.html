Each requirement is implemented in a section of the document which also contains rationale for the requirement.  The requirements are traced to the design model via electronic hyperlinks using Simulink Verification and Validation.</p><p><a href="matlab:winopen('do178b_autopilot_requirements.docx');">Open the requirements document</a></p><p>To view a block in the model that traces to a requirement, double click on one of the hyperlinks to the right of the section heading.  The <b>roll_ap</b> model will open and the block linked to the requirement will be highlighted in the model.</p><p>For more information about the <b>Requirements Management Interface</b> see the <b>Help for Simulink Verification and Validation</b>.  This describes how to interface to various document formats, including Word, as well as how to interface to DOORS.</p><p><a href="matlab:doc('slvnv');">Help for Simulink Verification and Validation</a></p><h2>System Requirements Validation<a name="3"></a></h2><p>Requirements validation is defined as showing that the requirements are complete and correct.  Requirements validation is typically performed by reviewing the requirements using a checklist, or similar means, based on requirements standards for the project.</p><p>ARP-4754A also calls out modeling, simulation and prototyping as methods of validating requirements.  As the system design is developed, as described in the following section on system design, simulation of the model may be used to ensure completeness and correctness of the requirements.  This simulation may uncover undesirable behavior that was not considered in the requirements or it may be determined that the requirements are not verifiable.  Hardware prototyping may also be used to validate requirements.  Simulink, Real-Time Workshop and xPC Target allow hardware in the loop prototyping that can be used as a part of requirements validation. Hardware prototyping is not covered in this demo.</p><h2>System Design<a name="4"></a></h2><p>The system design is implemented in the Simulink model <b>do178b_dhc2</b>.</p><p><a href="matlab:open_system('do178b_dhc2');">Open the system model</a></p><p>The top level of the model consists of the following subsystems:</p><div><ul><li>DeHavilland Beaver Airframe (plant model)</li><li>Environment (atmosphere, gravity and wind models)</li><li>Signal Conditioning (electrical to mechanical interfaces)</li><li>Air Data Sensor (sensor feedback model)</li><li>Inertial Data Sensor (sensor feedback model)</li><li>Cockpit Controls (pilot interface)</li><li>Engage and Mode Panel (autopilot interface/test stimulus)</li><li>Reference Signals (autopilot interface/test stimulus)</li><li>Verification_Blocks(requirements based test verification)</li></ul></div><p>The top level of the model also contians the following model reference block:</p><div><ul><li>Autopilot (controller model)</li></ul></div><p><a href="matlab:open_system('Autopilot');">Open the Autopilot model</a></p><p>The layout of the top level illustrates a basic system architecture that not only represents the system design, but also provides the capability to verify that the system design satisfies the system requirements.</p><p>The top level of the model includes a model information block showing the model version and date that the model was last saved.</p><p>The use of this model will be discussed in the following sections in more detail.</p><h2>System Design Verification<a name="5"></a></h2><p>With the system design implemented in the Simulink model <b>do178b_dhc2</b>, it is possible to verify the design against the system requirements without having to first implement that design in actual hardware and software.  This is the advantage of Model-Based Design.</p><p>At the top level of the model <b>do178B_dhc2</b>, there are three signal builder blocks provided to conduct specific tests during simulation. These blocks are:</p><div><ul><li>Engage and Mode Panel (autopilot interface/test stimulus)</li><li>Reference Signals (autopilot interface/test stimulus)</li><li>Cockpit Controls (pilot interface)</li></ul></div><p>Each of these blocks can be opened in the model by double clicking them to see the definition of the test signals and test groups within the signal builder blocks.  These blocks also contain traceability back to the system requirements document for the requirements that will be tested using each group of signals.  For more detailed information about how to use the signal builder blocks, see the help section for that block in Simulink Help.</p><p><a href="matlab:doc('simulink/signalbuilder');">Help for Signal Builder block</a></p><p>Signal stimulation can also be accomplished via other means, such as using other Simulink source blocks or by using From Workspace blocks in conjunction with MATLAB scripts or MAT files that load data to the workspace.  It is also possible to use the Data Import/Export Configuration Parameters dialogue to get data from the MATLAB workspace.</p><p>Of course test stimulus alone is not enough to verify the system design is satisfying the requirements.  Assertion blocks, which are contained in the subsystem <b>Verification_Blocks</b>, can be used to determine whether or not the system requirements are satisfied by the design during simulation.  To see the verification blocks open this subsystem.</p><p><a href="matlab:open_system('do178b_dhc2');open_system('do178b_dhc2/Verification_Blocks');">Open Verification_Blocks subsystem</a></p><p>The following four Assertion Blocks can be found in this subsystem</p><div><ul><li>Check Dynamic Roll</li><li>Check Roll Range</li><li>Check Roll Rate Range</li><li>Check Aileron Range</li></ul></div><p>The assertions <b>Check Roll Range</b>, <b>Check Roll Rate Range</b> and <b>Check Aileron Range</b> provide minimum and maximum values for roll angle, roll rate and aileron angle respectively.  These assertions are enabled during all test cases and the values are based on the <b>Autopilot Requirements Document</b>, including tolerances.  For example, the requirement for the maximum roll angle is 30 degrees +/-10%, which means the allowable roll angle is from -33 degrees to +33 degrees.</p><p>The assertion <b>Check Dynamic Roll</b> provides a window between minimum and maximum values that is dependent upon the test case being executed.  The signal builder block <b>Roll References</b> is used to provide the minimum and maximum values for each test case using signal groups. This block can be opened in the model by double clicking it to see the definition of the test signals and test groups within the signal builder block.  This block also contains traceability back to the system requirements document for the requirements that will be tested using each group of signals.</p><p>The use of three signal builder blocks for test stimulation and one signal builder block for assertion control requires that the selected groups of each of these blocks be coordinated.  <b>MATLAB Report Generator</b> is used for this coordination of the test cases and also to provide automated test case execution.</p><p><a href="matlab:setedit('Roll_AP_Tests_loop_sim');">Open Report Generator for this demo</a></p><p>MATLAB Report Generator provides a framework for setting up simulations, executing them, and finally generating a test report.

For this system design, the <b>Autopilot</b> subsystem in <b>do178b_dhc2</b> is being allocated to software, and therefore becomes the high level software requirements.</p><p><a href="matlab:open_system('Autopilot');">Open Autopilot model</a></p><p>It can be seen within the <b>Autopilot</b> model that the architecture is further broken down into <b>Roll_Autopilot</b>, <b>Pitch_Autopilot</b> and <b>Yaw_Damper</b>.  This provides several important features in the design:</p><div><ul><li>The roll, pitch and yaw axes of the autopilot are all configured as separate files which can be reviewed and tested independently</li><li>The source code for the roll, pitch and yaw axes are all configured as separate files which can be reviewed separately</li><li>The test harness is configured in a completely separate file and changes to the test harness do not affect the models used for embedded code generation</li></ul></div><p>We can now open the separate <b>roll_ap</b> model to see the actual functionality that is allocated to software.</p><p><a href="matlab:open_system('roll_ap');">Open roll_ap model</a></p><p>It can be seen within the <b>roll_ap</b> model that the architecture is further broken down into <b>Heading Mode</b>, <b>Roll Reference</b> and <b>Basic Roll Mode</b> systems.  <b>Heading Mode</b> and <b>Basic Roll Mode</b> are separate reference models, while <b>Roll Reference</b> is a subsystem. Either of these reference models or the subsystem can be opened, and the basic functionality comprised of Simulink blocks will be found.</p><p>The top level of the model includes a model information block showing the model version and date that the model was last saved.</p><p>To view a requirement associated with a block in the model, right click on the Mode Switch block, go to Requirements on the tab and then select "1.2. Roll Hold Mode" and the Autopilot Requirements document will open With section 1.2 Roll hold Mode highlighted.</p><h2>Software Requirements Verification<a name="7"></a></h2><p>For DO-331 it is necessary to have requirements verification artifacts with respect to compliance to the system requirements, accuracy and consistency, verifiability and algorithm accuracy.  The simulation activities described in the previous section can be used to cover these objectives in DO-331.</p><p>For ARP-4754A, DO-178C and DO-331, it is necessary to have an artifact that shows traceability between System Requirements and Software Requirements.  A <b>System Design Description</b> report can be generated using the <b>Simulink Report Generator</b> and this document contains a section that includes the traceability information from the model to the requirements document.

The Model Advisor provides the capability to perform static checks on the model in order to verify many standards automatically and to verify certain code generator option settings related to hardware compatibility.

For this function the code will be generated directly from the high level software requirements, therefore the model satisfies both the high and low level software requirements.</p><p>To view the architecture of the roll_ap model and it's referenced models open the following:</p><p><a href="matlab:view_mdlrefs('roll_ap');">Open Model Dependency Viewer for roll_ap</a></p><p>To view the architecture of the entire autopilot model and it's referenced models open the following:</p><p><a href="matlab:view_mdlrefs('Autopilot');">Open Model Dependency Viewer for Autopilot</a></p><p>There will be additional design and architecture activities that will be required beyond just the model in order to fully define the high and low level software requirements.  For example, there will be requirements and design associated with processing the inertial reference and air data sensor inputs, passing those inputs to the model inputs, and scheduling these two task in the proper order.  These activities are not included as a part of this demo.</p><h2>Software Design Verification<a name="9"></a></h2><p>Because the high and low level software requirements have been combined for this demo, the software requirements verification activities previously discussed are being used to also cover the software design verification activities.</p><h2>Source Code<a name="10"></a></h2><p>The source code is generated from the roll_ap model using Embedded Coder. The <b>ert.tlc</b> target is used for this demo.  The use of this target provides a good baseline for generating traceable and MISRA compliant code.  The Model Advisor for this demo is using configuration settings necessary for MISRA compliance and high integrity code.</p><p>The code for the roll_ap model and it's referenced modesl can be generated and an HTML report can be viewed by clicking the following link.</p><p><a href="matlab:slbuild('roll_ap','ModelReferenceRTWTargetOnly');">Generate code and open code generation report for roll_ap</a></p><p>The C code file  can be opened from the HTML report by clicking roll_ap.c.  To see how the code traces to the model go to line 93 and click on the link '&lt;S3&gt;/FixPt Unit Delay1'.  This will open the roll_ap model and highlight the Unit Delay block in the subsystem <b>Roll Reference</b> of roll_ap model.  Other trace links can be found in the code and examined if desired.  It can also be seen that code within the atomic subsystem, <b>Roll Reference</b> is clearly commented in the code file and contained on contiguous lines.</p><h2>Source Code Verification<a name="11"></a></h2><p>Source code verification is performed using <b>Simulink Code Inspector</b> and <b>Polyspace</b>.  Simulink Code Inspector verifies that the source code structurally and functionally matches the model.  The Simulink Code Inspector also verifies that the model and code trace to each other. To run the code inspection on roll_ap, click on the link below.</p><p><a href="matlab:config=slci.Configuration('roll_ap');config.setTopModel(false);config.setGenerateCode(false);config.setFollowModelLinks(true);config.inspect;open([pwd%20'\slprj\slci\roll_ap_summaryReport.html']);">Inspect roll_ap and reference model code and generate summary report</a></p><p>PolySpace Products perform verification activities on the source code. This includes a MISRA-AC-ACG checker that can verify the code conforms to standards.  A static analysis tool performs checks on the code to look for potential run time errors, unreachable code, un-initialized variables or data coupling issues.</p><p>Polyspace is not currently part of this demo.</p><h2>Executable Object Code<a name="12"></a></h2><p>The executable object code will be generated from the source code using third party compilers/linkers.  Embedded Coder can assist in the generation of make files for the software build process or this can be done manually.  See the Embedded Coder Help for more information about this capability.</p><p><a href="matlab:doc('ecoder');">Help for Embedded Coder</a></p><h2>Executable Object Code Verification<a name="13"></a></h2><p>The executable object code may be verified using the Processor-In-The_Loop mode (PIL) availble with Embedded Coder.  This allows the simulation cases run using the report generator to be re-run easily on a traget board connected to Simulink via a serial bus.  For more informaiton about PIL mode, see the Embedded Coder help:</p><p><a href="matlab:doc('ecoder');">Help for Embedded Coder</a></p><p>PIL mode is not currently part of this demo.</p><p>During requirements based testing it is also necessary to perform structural coverage analysis on the code to measure statement (Levels A, B and C), decision (Levels A and B) and modified condition/decision coverage (Level A).  This is normally considered to be one of the most expensive and time consuming aspects of DO-178C objectives.</p><p>During execution of the tests on the object code using the PIL mode, it is recommended to use a code coverage tool to evaluate the structural coverage of the code.  There are many third party coverage tools available for analyzing code coverage.  Some of these tools instrument the code, in which case the tests need to be run on instrumented and un-instrumented versions of the object code.  Embedded Coder provides integration with Bullseye and LDRA code coverage tools.</p><h2>Conclusion<a name="14"></a></h2><p>The purpose of this demo was to provide a possible approach to satisfying many of the objectives of DO-178C when using a Model-Based Design process.  Other approaches and variations to the approach in this demo are also possible.</p><p>Here is a list of potential advantages when using Model-Based Design with The MathWorks tools:</p><div><ul><li>Early requirements validation as the design process starts</li><li>Verification of the design and elimination of errors early in development</li><li>Test case and procedure development early in the project, not as an afterthought</li><li>Coverage metrics early in the project, no surprises or extra work at the end</li><li>Improved code quality via automatic code generation</li><li>Automated source code analysis and standards compliance checking</li><li>Automated test execution provides simplified but thorough regression testing</li><li>Complete traceability between requirements, design, code and test cases</li></ul></div><p class="footer"><br><a href="http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/">Published with MATLAB&reg; R2012b</a><br></p></div><!--

%% System Requirements
% The system requirements for the roll axis of the autopilot are provided 
% in a Microsoft Word document.  Each requirement is implemented in a
% section of the document which also contains rationale for the
% requirement.  The requirements are traced to the design model via
% electronic hyperlinks using Simulink Verification and Validation.
%
% <matlab:winopen('do178b_autopilot_requirements.docx'); Open the
% requirements document>
%
% To view a block in the model that traces to a requirement, double click
% on one of the hyperlinks to the right of the section heading.  The
% *roll_ap* model will open and the block linked to the requirement will be
% highlighted in the model.
%
% For more information about the *Requirements Management Interface* see
% the *Help for Simulink Verification and Validation*.  This describes how
% to interface to various document formats, including Word, as well as how
% to interface to DOORS.
%
% <matlab:doc('slvnv'); Help for Simulink Verification and Validation>
%
%% System Requirements Validation
%
% Requirements validation is defined as showing that the requirements are
% complete and correct.  Requirements validation is typically performed by
% reviewing the requirements using a checklist, or similar means, based on
% requirements standards for the project.  
%
% ARP-4754A also calls out modeling, simulation and prototyping as methods 
% of validating requirements.  As the system design is developed, as 
% described in the following section on system design, simulation of the 
% model may be used to ensure completeness and correctness of the
% requirements.  This simulation may uncover undesirable behavior that was
% not considered in the requirements or it may be determined that the
% requirements are not verifiable.  Hardware prototyping may also be used
% to validate requirements.  Simulink, Real-Time Workshop and xPC Target 
% allow hardware in the loop prototyping that can be used as a part of
% requirements validation. Hardware prototyping is not covered in this
% demo.
%% System Design
% The system design is implemented in the Simulink model *do178b_dhc2*. 
% 
% <matlab:open_system('do178b_dhc2'); Open the system model> 
%
% The top level of the model consists of the following subsystems:
% 
% * DeHavilland Beaver Airframe (plant model)
% * Environment (atmosphere, gravity and wind models)
% * Signal Conditioning (electrical to mechanical interfaces)
% * Air Data Sensor (sensor feedback model)
% * Inertial Data Sensor (sensor feedback model)
% * Cockpit Controls (pilot interface)
% * Engage and Mode Panel (autopilot interface/test stimulus)
% * Reference Signals (autopilot interface/test stimulus)
% * Verification_Blocks(requirements based test verification)
% 
% The top level of the model also contians the following model reference
% block:
%
% * Autopilot (controller model)
% 
% <matlab:open_system('Autopilot'); Open the Autopilot model> 
%
% The layout of the top level illustrates a basic system architecture that
% not only represents the system design, but also provides the capability
% to verify that the system design satisfies the system requirements.
%
% The top level of the model includes a model information block showing the
% model version and date that the model was last saved.
%
% The use of this model will be discussed in the following sections in more
% detail.
%% System Design Verification
%
% With the system design implemented in the Simulink model *do178b_dhc2*,
% it is possible to verify the design against the system requirements
% without having to first implement that design in actual hardware and
% software.  This is the advantage of Model-Based Design.  
%
% At the top level of the model *do178B_dhc2*, there are three signal 
% builder blocks provided to conduct specific tests during simulation.  
% These blocks are:
%
% * Engage and Mode Panel (autopilot interface/test stimulus)
% * Reference Signals (autopilot interface/test stimulus)
% * Cockpit Controls (pilot interface)
%
% Each of these blocks can be opened in the model by double clicking them
% to see the definition of the test signals and test groups within the
% signal builder blocks.  These blocks also contain traceability back to
% the system requirements document for the requirements that will be tested
% using each group of signals.  For more detailed information about how to
% use the signal builder blocks, see the help section for that block in
% Simulink Help.
%
% <matlab:doc('simulink/signalbuilder'); Help for Signal Builder block>
%
% Signal stimulation can also be accomplished via other means, such as
% using other Simulink source blocks or by using From Workspace blocks in
% conjunction with MATLAB scripts or MAT files that load data to the 
% workspace.  It is also possible to use the Data Import/Export 
% Configuration Parameters dialogue to get data from the MATLAB workspace.
%
% Of course test stimulus alone is not enough to verify the system design
% is satisfying the requirements.  Assertion blocks, which are contained in
% the subsystem *Verification_Blocks*, can be used to determine whether or
% not the system requirements are satisfied by the design during
% simulation.  To see the verification blocks open this subsystem.
%
% <matlab:open_system('do178b_dhc2');open_system('do178b_dhc2/Verification_Blocks');
% Open Verification_Blocks subsystem>
%
% The following four Assertion Blocks can be found in this subsystem
%
% * Check Dynamic Roll
% * Check Roll Range
% * Check Roll Rate Range
% * Check Aileron Range
%
% The assertions *Check Roll Range*, *Check Roll Rate Range* and *Check
% Aileron Range* provide minimum and maximum values for roll angle, roll
% rate and aileron angle respectively.  These assertions are enabled during
% all test cases and the values are based on the *Autopilot Requirements
% Document*, including tolerances.  For example, the requirement for the
% maximum roll angle is 30 degrees +/-10%, which means the allowable roll
% angle is from -33 degrees to +33 degrees.
%
% The assertion *Check Dynamic Roll* provides a window between minimum and
% maximum values that is dependent upon the test case being executed.  The
% signal builder block *Roll References* is used to provide the minimum and
% maximum values for each test case using signal groups. This block can be 
% opened in the model by double clicking it to see the definition of the
% test signals and test groups within the signal builder block.  This block
% also contains traceability back to the system requirements document for
% the requirements that will be tested using each group of signals.
%
% The use of three signal builder blocks for test stimulation and one
% signal builder block for assertion control requires that the selected
% groups of each of these blocks be coordinated.  *MATLAB Report Generator*
% is used for this coordination of the test cases and also to provide
% automated test case execution.  
%
% <matlab:setedit('Roll_AP_Tests_loop_sim'); Open Report Generator for this demo>
%
% MATLAB Report Generator provides a framework for setting up simulations, 
% executing them, and finally generating a test report.  For more 
% information about MATLAB Report Generator, see the help.
%
% <matlab:doc('rptgen'); Help for Report Generator>
%
% The report file *Roll_AP_Tests_loop_sim.rpt* perfoms the following
% sequence to run the simulation cases and procedures, as well as verifying
% the results:
%
% * Opens the test harness model and inserts a snapshot into the report
% * Opens the autopilot model and inserts a snapshot into the report
% * Opens the verification subsystem in the test harness model and inserts
% a snapshot into the report
% * Sets up arrays for Signal Builder block cases, initial Roll Angles,
% Test Descriptions and Test Criterias for 20 different tests
% * Executes a loop of 20 simulation cases that include the following:
%
% # Lists the requirements being verified for each individual iteration
% # Lists a description of the test for each individual iteration
% # Lists the test results criteria for each individual iteration
% # Sets the initial roll angle for each individual iteration
% # Sets the Signal Builder blocks cases for each individual iteration
% # Runs the simulation of the test harness for each individual iteration
% # Generates a plot of the simualtion results for each individual iteration
% # Generates a pass or fail indication of the  results for each individual
% iteration
%
% * Inserts a link to the model coverage cummulative summary report
% * Provides a summary pass or fail indication for the cumulative results
%
% To run the simulations, clidk on the link below, this will take a few
% minutes to execute.
%
% <matlab:report('Roll_AP_Tests_loop_sim.rpt'); Generate Simulation Report>
%
% A Model Coverage report is also generated during testing. To view this
% report click on the link below.
%
% <matlab:open('roll_ap_cov.html'); Open the Model Coverage report for roll_ap>
%
%% Software Requirements
% From the system design, specific functions are allocated to software in
% order to form the software requirements.  For this system design, the
% *Autopilot* subsystem in *do178b_dhc2* is being allocated to software,
% and therefore becomes the high level software requirements.
%
% <matlab:open_system('Autopilot'); Open Autopilot model>
%
% It can be seen within the *Autopilot* model that the architecture is
% further broken down into *Roll_Autopilot*, *Pitch_Autopilot* and
% *Yaw_Damper*.  This provides several important features in the design:
%
% * The roll, pitch and yaw axes of the autopilot are all configured as
% separate files which can be reviewed and tested independently
% * The source code for the roll, pitch and yaw axes are all configured as
% separate files which can be reviewed separately
% * The test harness is configured in a completely separate file and
% changes to the test harness do not affect the models used for embedded
% code generation
%
% We can now open the separate *roll_ap* model to see the actual
% functionality that is allocated to software.
%
% <matlab:open_system('roll_ap'); Open roll_ap model> 
%
% It can be seen within the *roll_ap* model that the architecture is
% further broken down into *Heading Mode*, *Roll Reference* and
% *Basic Roll Mode* systems.  *Heading Mode* and *Basic Roll Mode* are 
% separate reference models, while *Roll Reference* is a subsystem. Either 
% of these reference models or the subsystem can be opened, and the basic
% functionality comprised of Simulink blocks will be found.
%
% The top level of the model includes a model information block showing the
% model version and date that the model was last saved.
%
% To view a requirement associated with a block in the model, right click
% on the Mode Switch block, go to Requirements on the tab and then select 
% "1.2. Roll Hold Mode" and the Autopilot Requirements document will open
% With section 1.2 Roll hold Mode highlighted. 
%% Software Requirements Verification
% For DO-331 it is necessary to have requirements verification artifacts
% with respect to compliance to the system requirements, accuracy and
% consistency, verifiability and algorithm accuracy.  The simulation
% activities described in the previous section can be used to cover these 
% objectives in DO-331.  
%
% For ARP-4754A, DO-178C and DO-331, it is necessary to have an artifact
% that shows traceability between System Requirements and Software
% Requirements.  A *System Design Description* report can be generated
% using the *Simulink Report Generator* and this document contains a
% section that includes the traceability information from the model to the
% requirements document.  This report may take a few minutes to complete.
%
% <matlab:open_system('roll_ap');rptcfg=StdRpt.SDD(gcs);rptcfg.run();
% Generate the System Design Description report>
%
% This report provides a complete description of the model, including:
%
% * Snapshots of the top level model and all subsystems
% * Interfaces for the top model and all subsystems
% * Block execution order
% * Details of all block dialogue settings
% * Details of all parameters and signals used in the model
% * Traceability from the model objects to the requirements document
% * Details of all the model configuration settings
% * Glossary and report explanation
%
% For more information about the *Requirements Management Interface* see
% the *Help for Simulink Verification and Validation*.  This describes how
% to interface to various document formats, including Word, as well as how
% to interface to DOORS.
%
% <matlab:doc('slvnv'); Help for Simulink Verification and Validation>
%
% As a part of the DO-178C lifecycle, the high and low level requirements
% must be verified to comply with standards and it must also be shown that
% the requirements are compatible with the target computer.  The Model
% Advisor provides the capability to perform static checks on the model in
% order to verify many standards automatically and to verify certain code
% generator option settings related to hardware compatibility.  To generate
% the Model Advisor report for the roll_ap model, select the link below.
% This may take a few minutes to complete.
%
% <matlab:open_system('roll_ap');ma=Simulink.ModelAdvisor.getModelAdvisor('roll_ap');IDs=ma.getCheckForGroup('Simulink%20Verification%20and%20Validation|Modeling%20Standards|DO-178C/DO-331%20Checks');marpt=ModelAdvisor.run('roll_ap',IDs);marpt{1}.viewReport;
% Generate roll_ap model advisor report>
%
%% Software Design and Architecture
% The software design and architecture is defined within the roll_ap model
% and the Heading_Mode and attitude_controller reference models for the
% control portion of the roll autopilot function.  For this function the
% code will be generated directly from the high level software
% requirements, therefore the model satisfies both the high and low level
% software requirements.
% 
% To view the architecture of the roll_ap model and it's referenced models
% open the following:
%
% <matlab:view_mdlrefs('roll_ap'); Open Model Dependency Viewer for roll_ap>
%
% To view the architecture of the entire autopilot model and it's
% referenced models open the following:
%
% <matlab:view_mdlrefs('Autopilot'); Open Model Dependency Viewer for Autopilot>
%
% There will be additional design and architecture activities that will be
% required beyond just the model in order to fully define the high and low
% level software requirements.  For example, there will be requirements and
% design associated with processing the inertial reference and air data
% sensor inputs, passing those inputs to the model inputs, and scheduling
% these two task in the proper order.  These activities are not included as
% a part of this demo.
%% Software Design Verification
% Because the high and low level software requirements have been combined 
% for this demo, the software requirements verification activities 
% previously discussed are being used to also cover the software design
% verification activities.
%% Source Code
% The source code is generated from the roll_ap model using Embedded Coder.
% The *ert.tlc* target is used for this demo.  The use of this target
% provides a good baseline for generating traceable and MISRA compliant
% code.  The Model Advisor for this demo is using configuration settings
% necessary for MISRA compliance and high integrity code.  
%
% The code for the roll_ap model and it's referenced modesl can be 
% generated and an HTML report can be viewed by clicking the following link.
%
% <matlab:slbuild('roll_ap','ModelReferenceRTWTargetOnly');
% Generate code and open code generation report for roll_ap>
%
% The C code file  can be opened from the HTML report by clicking
% roll_ap.c.  To see how the code traces to the model go to line 93 and
% click on the link '<S3>/FixPt Unit Delay1'.  This will open the roll_ap
% model and highlight the Unit Delay block in the subsystem *Roll
% Reference* of roll_ap model.  Other trace links can be found in the code
% and examined if desired.  It can also be seen that code within the atomic
% subsystem, *Roll Reference* is clearly commented in the code file and
% contained on contiguous lines. 
%
%% Source Code Verification
% Source code verification is performed using *Simulink Code Inspector* and
% *Polyspace*.  Simulink Code Inspector verifies that the source code
% structurally and functionally matches the model.  The Simulink Code
% Inspector also verifies that the model and code trace to each other. To
% run the code inspection on roll_ap, click on the link below.
%
% <matlab:config=slci.Configuration('roll_ap');config.setTopModel(false);config.setGenerateCode(false);config.setFollowModelLinks(true);config.inspect;open([pwd%20'\slprj\slci\roll_ap_summaryReport.html']);
% Inspect roll_ap and reference model code and generate summary report>
%
% PolySpace Products perform verification activities on the source code.
% This includes a MISRA-AC-ACG checker that can verify the code conforms to 
% standards.  A static analysis tool performs checks on the code to look 
% for potential run time errors, unreachable code, un-initialized variables
% or data coupling issues.  
%
% Polyspace is not currently part of this demo.
%% Executable Object Code
% The executable object code will be generated from the source code using
% third party compilers/linkers.  Embedded Coder can assist in the
% generation of make files for the software build process or this can be
% done manually.  See the Embedded Coder Help for more information about
% this capability.
%
% <matlab:doc('ecoder'); Help for Embedded Coder>
%% Executable Object Code Verification
% The executable object code may be verified using the
% Processor-In-The_Loop mode (PIL) availble with Embedded Coder.  This
% allows the simulation cases run using the report generator to be re-run
% easily on a traget board connected to Simulink via a serial bus.  For
% more informaiton about PIL mode, see the Embedded Coder help:
%
% <matlab:doc('ecoder'); Help for Embedded Coder>
%
% PIL mode is not currently part of this demo.
%
% During requirements based testing it is also necessary to perform
% structural coverage analysis on the code to measure statement (Levels A,
% B and C), decision (Levels A and B) and modified condition/decision
% coverage (Level A).  This is normally considered to be one of the most
% expensive and time consuming aspects of DO-178C objectives.  
% 
% During execution of the tests on the object code using the PIL mode, it
% is recommended to use a code coverage tool to evaluate the structural 
% coverage of the code.  There are many third party coverage tools
% available for analyzing code coverage.  Some of these tools instrument
% the code, in which case the tests need to be run on instrumented and
% un-instrumented versions of the object code.  Embedded Coder provides
% integration with Bullseye and LDRA code coverage tools.
%% Conclusion
% The purpose of this demo was to provide a possible approach to satisfying
% many of the objectives of DO-178C when using a Model-Based Design
% process.  Other approaches and variations to the approach in this demo
% are also possible.
%
% Here is a list of potential advantages when using Model-Based Design with
% The MathWorks tools:
% 
% * Early requirements validation as the design process starts
% * Verification of the design and elimination of errors early in
% development
% * Test case and procedure development early in the project, not as an
% afterthought
% * Coverage metrics early in the project, no surprises or extra work at
% the end
% * Improved code quality via automatic code generation
% * Automated source code analysis and standards compliance checking
% * Automated test execution provides simplified but thorough regression
% testing
% * Complete traceability between requirements, design, code and test cases
