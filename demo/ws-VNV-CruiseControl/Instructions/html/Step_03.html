%% Step 3: Detecting Design Errors
%
%% Introduction
%
% <<Step_03_CruiseControl_WhatNow.png>>
%
% There are many different ways to perform testing in Simulink.
% Traditionally, verification involves the user creating a set of test
% vectors based on certain requirements. The user can also create a set of
% expected outputs matching the giving inputs, or visually analyze the
% simulation making sure the behavior is as expected. The type of test
% vector created can be either functional, or based on certain robustness
% criteria or standards. With this method, the quality of the test is
% entirely based on the quality of the input vectors and being able to
% capture or reproduce a real world scenario as closely as possible. This
% topic is covered in *Step 4:  Testing by Simulation*. 
%
% One of the benefits of Model-Based Design is the ability to apply other
% “non-simulation” techniques to your model. These formal techniques are 
% most beneficial when you are working with logic-intensive models. In this
% section, we will use *Simulink Design Verifier* to formally analyze our 
% model for us to check if there are any unreachable states or
% transitions and if there are any divide by zero design errors.  The 
% recommendation is to run these checks before executing the simulation
% based tests to catch errors early and have a more efficient testing 
% workflow.
%
% There are three main functions *Simulink Design Verifier*:
%
% # *Design Error Detection*:  Focus of this step, finds hard to find
% design errors including dead logic, divide by zero, overflow and out of 
% bound array access
% # *Test Generation*: Focus of *Step 5:  Test Case Generation*, generate 
% test cases based on model objectives and/or coverage objectives to
% augment functional test cases
% # *Property Proving*:  Focus of *Step 7:  Property Proving*, model the
% expected behavior and prove the implementation will always meet
% requirements
%
%% Verification and Validation Tools Used
%
% * Simulink Design Verifier
%
%% Running Dead Logic Detection on the Model
%
% In this step, we are going to use Simulink Design Verifier to analyze our
% model. Our goal is find dead (unreachable) logic. We can also analyze our
% model for design errors like integer overflows, division by zero and out
% of bound array access. 
%
% *_Simulink Design Verifer uses formal methods which
% means that the analysis is "exhaustive" compared to simulation-based
% testing which is "non-exhaustive"._*
%
% We will be using the "CruiseControl" model similar to the model used in
% the ad-hoc testing we performed on the floating point, prototype model.  
% Our goal is to generate production code, so one step towards production 
% will be replacing the floating point signals and parameters with integer 
% types.
%
% To perform the dead logic analysis, do the following:
%
% 1.  Open *CruiseControl_IntCalc.slx* – *<matlab:B1_DED_DeadLogic click here>*.
%
% 2.  Go to *Analysis*, *Design Verifier*, and *Options*.
%
% <<Step_03_DV_OptMenu.png>>
%
% 3.  Go to *Design Error Detection*, check *Dead logic*, check 
% *Identify active logic* and select *OK*.
%
% <<Step_03_DV_OptUI.png>>
%
% 4.  Go to *Analysis*, *Design Verifier*, *Detect Design Errors*, and
% select *Model*.
%
% <<Step_03_DV_RunDetectDesignErrors.png>>
%
% The following status window should appear. Near the top of the status
% window, there is information that tells the user the current status.  In
% this case, the model has total of (70) objectives. Each objective matches
% a particular coverage criterion. For each decision or transition, there
% are two objectives: one for decision result of true and one for false.
% There are also two objectives for each condition.  So a single condition
% decision would only have (2) objectives but a double condition objective
% would have (6) objectives:  (2) for the decision and (4) for the two
% conditions.
% 
% <<Step_03_DV_DetectDesignErros_Progress.png>>
% 
% *The analysis will show (2) falsified objectives.*
% 
% Falsified objectives mean that there are dead logic in the model, and
% there are no test vectors that will ever achieve those missing coverage
% objectives. When the analysis has been completed, the results are
% displayed using model coloring (green = active logic, red = dead logic).
% In addition, a detailed report is also generated. See pictures below.
% 
% <<Step_03_DV_ResultsColors.png>>
%
% <<Step_03_AnalysisReport.png>>
%
% Please take a few minutes to see if you can find the reason why the 
% objective was falsified by the tool. The solution is given in the next section.
%
%% Analyzing the Dead Logic Detection Results
%
% Let’s take a look at the results and see what might be causing the error.
% Do the following:
%
% 1.  Navigate to the *Stateflow Chart* in the *CruiseControl_IntCalc* model. 
% The chart is colored in *green (= active logic)* and *red (= dead logic)*.
%
% 2.  Click on the *red transition arrow* which is where the dead logic has
% been found.
%
% The following information is displayed:
%
% <<Step_03_DV_ResultsColors.png>>
%
% This means that Transition Condition 2, *after(incdec/holdrate*10,tick)* 
% can never be false. But why can this transition not be false?  
% We will use the main model, *CruiseControl_IntCalc* to help us gain 
% insight into why the transition can never be false.
%
% 3.  Set a breakpoint on the default transition with the setting 
% *When transition is valid*.
% 
% <<Step_03_DV_IntCalcSetBreakpoint.png>>
%
% 3.  Run the main model and examine the transition in the MATLAB Command 
% Window by entering commands as shown below:  
%
% <<Step_03_DV_IntCalcDebugWindow.png>>
%
% As we study the parameters used in the transition calculation, we find
% that by replacing the floating point parameters with integer type parameters, 
% the transition calculation will always be zero. 
% 
% 4.  Replace the transition calculation *after(incdec/holdrate*10,tick)*
% with a change in the order of calculations to *after(10*incdec/holdrate,tick)*
% or to load the fix *CruiseControl_IntCalcFix.slx* – 
% *<matlab:bdclose('all');clear('all');open_system('CruiseControl_IntCalcFix.slx'); click here>*.
% 
% 5.  Rerun the dead logic analysis.  Go to *Analysis*, *Design Verifier*,
% *Detect Design Errors*, and select *Model*.  Confirm the transition 
% condition design error is now fixed.
%
% <<Step_03_DV_DeadLogicFixed.png>>
%
%% Running Divide by Zero Detection on the Model
%
% Another feature of *Design Error Detection* is the ability to
% analyze the model for calculations that result in a divide by zero.  For 
% the dead logic detection we used the nominal calibration value of (5) for the
% "holdrate" and (1) for "incdec".  Calibrations typically have a range of values
% that are permissible within specified limits. *Simulink Design Verifier* 
% provides a means to perform the analysis over a range of values.  To 
% perform the "divide by zero" analysis, do the following:
%
% 1.  Open *CruiseControl_DivByZero.slx* – *<matlab:B2_DED_DivideByZero; click here>*.
%
% 2.  Specify a range of parameters to be used for the analysis. 
% Go to *Analysis*, *Design Verifier*, and *Options* to open the 
% configuration window.
%
% 3.  Go to *Parameters*, check *Enable parameter configuration*, check 
% *Use parameter table*.  Select *Find in Model* to populate the parameter
% table.  Uncheck the *Use* column for "maxtspeed" and "mintspeed". 
%
% <<Step_03_DV_ParamTable.png>>
%
% 4.  In the same configuration dialog, go to *Design Error Detection*, 
% check *Division by zero*, and select *OK*.
%
% <<Step_03_DV_CfgDivByZero.png>>
%
% 5. Go to *Analysis*, *Design Verifier*, *Detect Design Errors*, and
% select *Model* to run the analysis.
%
%% Analyzing the Divide by Zero Detection Results
%
% Let’s take a look at the results and see what might be causing the error.
% Do the following:
%
% 1.  In the *Results Inspector* window, select *Generate detailed analysis
% results*.  We will look at the results to help us debug the divide by 
% zero issue.
%
% <<Step_03_DV_DivByZeroReport.png>>
%
% Since the analysis included the use of a parameter table to specify a
% range of parameter values that were part of the analysis.  Navigate in 
% the report to the "Parameter Constraints" section to verify the range 
% that was used in the analysis.  Next look at the generated test cases,

%% Automating Design Error Detection Checks
%
% What we have shown is an interactive, manual way to run the checks.  
% There is an automated method to run the *Design Error Detection* checks
% on the model with *Model Advisor*.
%
% # Go to *Analysis*, *Model Advisor* and select *Model Advisor*
% # In the popup window, choose the top model, *CruiseControl_DivByZero* to
% analyze 
% # As shown below, navigate to *Model Advisor*, *By Product*, *Simulink 
% Design Verifier*, *Design Error Detection*
% # Select (2) checks to run: *^Detect Dead Logic* and *^Detect Division By
% Zero*
% # Press *Run Selected Checks* for the *Design Error Detection* group of
% checks
%
% <<Step_03_DV_MdlAdvCfg.png>>
%
% <<Step_03_DV_MdlAdvResults.png>>
%
% With the inclusion of *Design Error Checks* in *Model Advisor* you now
% have the option of adding these checks as part of your development and 
% testing workflow.  These checks may be a pre-condition to begin the more
% formalized testing shown in *Step 4: Testing by Simulation*.
%% Summary
%
% With the functions above, we were able check our Cruise Control model 
% for difficult design errors like dead logic and divide by zero.  The 
% analysis was very automated with minimal work to configure the analysis
% to run on our model.  We utilized the *Design Error Detection* function 
% of *Simulink Design Verifer* to find the design errors.    
%
% The *Design Error Detection* function is based on formal methods which 
% does not require dynamic execution of the model or the creation of test 
% vectors to perform the analysis.  Formal methods use the entire specified
% range of signals and parameters to prove the absence of design errors.
% If during the analysis, a design error is found then a test case is 
% generated including the input test vectors and parameter values.  A test 
% harness can also be created to execute the test case to isolate and fix 
% the design issue.  
%
% When the *Design Error Detection* analysis was performed on our Cruise 
% Control model, two types of design issues were found:  dead logic and 
% divide by zero.  It was easy to use the generated test harnesses to fix 
% these issues.  We were able to find and fix these issues early in our 
% development process, increasing confidence in our design.  We will 
% continue to answer more of the questions in the next steps with our 
% structured and formal testing framework for securing the quality, 
% robustness and safety of our cruise controller.
