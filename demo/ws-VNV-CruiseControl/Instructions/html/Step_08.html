%% Step 8: Workshop Summary

% <<Step_08_OverallWorkflow.png>>
%
% We started with the overall workflow as shown above, and worked through a series
% of exercises to add continuous verification and validation activities to the 
% workflow.  In the end, we established a structured, formal testing framework 
% for securing the quality, robustness and safety of our cruise controller:
%
% # _Showed benefits of ad-hoc testing for finding issues early,_
% # _Linked textual requirements to the model and source code for
% traceability and early verification of requirements,_
% # _Enforced modeling standards for model readability and source
% code efficiency, enabling re-use._
% # _Detected model design errors like "dead logic" and "divide by zero"
% using formal verification techniques,_
% # _Dynamically tested the design using simulation test harnesses with requirements based input 
% test vectors and expected outputs to verify design behavior meets 
% the requirements,_
% # _Verified the generated source code, compiled for host (SIL) and
% production hardware (PIL), by testing for equvalence in behavior with
% model,_
% # _Modeled and validated key safety requirements using formal proofs._

%
% We have seen how to create and re-use test assets but there is more to
% consider when implementing a V&V workflow:
%
% 1.  _*Creation of test inputs.*_  These have been in the form of time
% traces, managed in spreadsheets.  But we could also use .mat files to 
% import into the Signal Builder block.  But it's also possible to map a 
% .mat file to the root inports.  Test inputs could be in the form of a 
% MATLAB function block or be managed in a Stateflow chart.
%
% 2.  _*Creation of test harnesses.*_  We have seen how to create these with 
% the *Test Harness* functionality of *Simulink Test*.  But what
% if you want to run tests on a subsystem in the model?  Testing and
% debugging subsystems although not shown in the workshop is a core 
% functionality of *Simulink Test* that includes synchronization of changes
% between the source model and the subsystem test harness. It is also 
% possible to run the model by the *root inport* mapping method to apply 
% test inputs directly to the algorithm model.  Mapping .mat files and 
% spreadsheet data to root inports is also supported in the *Test Manager*.
% So with this method no test harnesses are required.  But you will still 
% need to consider how the outputs will be verified.
%
% 3.  _*Verification of results.*_  We have seen how to do this in the test
% harness with the expected outputs with simple comparison operators and
% also using the *compare runs* function of *SDI*.  But there are other
% ways to do the evaluation including using more sophisticated models to 
% do online checking.  In addition, the evaluation could be a MATLAB
% function block or a Stateflow chart.  The unit under test may have
% several inputs and outputs that can be ignored at different times using
% validation time windows to specify when the evaluation is active.  How
% the tests are executed needs to considered since this is often coupled to
% the selected evaluation method.  We have seen how to manually run the 
% model and do online evaluations. We have also shown how the *Test Manager*
% will run the tests, perform the evaluation and produce a test report.
%
% 4.  _*Test automation.*_  Several methods have been presented, starting with 
% using the "Run All" button in Signal Builder to automate test execution
% with test inputs and outputs stored in *SDI* for manual evaluation.  Next
% a script was created using the *SDI* API to automate the evaluation and
% creation of test reports.  Lastly, *Report Generator* was used to
% completely automate the loading of model, test execution, evaluation and
% the report creation.
%
% The general idea is to consider what methods will work best for your
% development and testing process based on the above points and other
% considerations.  These may include the available resources to develop 
% and maintain a custom process and tools.  So often it is better to begin 
% in a minimal way and then add as necessary through continuous improvement.
% Another consideration is the archiving of test result and the sharing or
% re-use of test assets.
