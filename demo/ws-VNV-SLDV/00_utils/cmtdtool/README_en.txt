cmtdtool
 
[Overview]
cmtdtool is an assistant tool for model-based testing in MBD processes. 
Initially, this tool is developed for JMAAB-CMTD-WS (JMAAB: Japan MBD Automotive Advisory Board, 
CMTD-WS: Control Model Test Design Working Group). After several improvements upon feedback from 
the JMAAB-CMTD-WG members, it is published to MATLAB Central.
Test design, composing test model, test execution, and reporting are performed 
when you run tests for a controller model. This tool helps you to reduce and automate 
manual operations required to perform them.
