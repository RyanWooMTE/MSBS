To run the workshop: 

1. Startup the project IEC62304.prj 

2. Go to the project files view and show the layout, 
	Architecture with C for Composition and F for function (module)
	Each function has the corresponding Tests folder

3. Artefacts show where we have all of the documentation available which is used as evidence for running through all of the verification steps

3. The shortcuts show the different process steps we are automating to run design/implementation and V&V for the process
	
4. Use the module CompFeatures to show the shortcuts in action, this is suitable and has Tests and reuqirements linking in place.
